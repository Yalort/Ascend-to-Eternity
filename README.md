# Agent-Based Simulation Game

This project contains a small prototype for an idle, emergent-storytelling simulation.
Agents act autonomously over time using a simple behavior engine built with
[mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) and [simpy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/).

Run the simulation:

```bash
python main.py
```

Logs are written to `data/simulation.log`.
